# You predictor
<h2>This app takes input from the user and outputs data based on information provided by the user</h2>
<p>The code gets a bit not too pretty as we nest a lot of if blocks but I have commented on sections of code to amke it easier to read, also spaced things out quite nicely</p>
<p>The user prdictions section(after data is collected) section of the code as adapted from the name makes conditional statements with if else statemnets and cahins logical operators to try to make a more sophisticated "prediction" about the user</p>
<p>Also please ignore "predictor" word context as it is used here</p>
